# Xnoe Notes

A simplistic notes application with minimal download / upload support. Entirely client side and houses within a single <200line HTML file.

Notes are stored within Localstorage (giving a theoretical 5MB maxiumum note capacity, meaning with normal usage, users aren't going to exceed this). Notes are automagically saved so there's no need for a save button.

File deletion and renaming support too.
